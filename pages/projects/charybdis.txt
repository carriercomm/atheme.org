Charybdis is an ircd used on various networks either as itself, or as the basis
of a customized IRC server implementation.  A derivative of charybdis,
[ircd-seven][seven] powers [freenode][fn], which is the largest IRC network in
the world, according to irc.netsplit.de.

### bi-directional collaboration with other IRC server projects

One of the purposes of the charybdis project is to provide a testbed for the
research and development of new features in IRC server software.  To this end,
we have contributed patches to other IRC software, such as [ratbox][rb] and
[ircu][ircu].

Charybdis is originally based on ratbox 2.0, with some additional code from
ircu 2.11, but a large number of features from Charybdis were integrated back
into ratbox with ratbox 3, and ircu 2.12, and contributions are contributed
bi-directionally on a regular basis.  To this extent, Charybdis can be considered
a top-level IRCd project, and not a patchset to a different IRCd project.

As part of our mission, we have collaborated with other IRCd projects besides
ratbox and ircu, in terms of technical development, such as [UnrealIRCd][unreal] and
[InspIRCd][insp].  The Charybdis project also is represented in the
[IRCv3 working group][ircv3wg], which itself is incubated by Atheme.
