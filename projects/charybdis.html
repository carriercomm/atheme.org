  <h1>charybdis <small>a highly-scalable ircv3-compliant irc daemon</small></h1>
</div>

<p class="lead">charybdis is an ircd used on various networks either as itself, or as the basis of a customized IRC server implementation.  A derivative of charybdis,
  <a href="http://www.freenode.net/seven.shtml">ircd-seven</a> powers <a href="http://www.freenode.net/">freenode</a>, which is the largest IRC network in the world.</p>

<h2>Collaboration with other IRC server projects</h2>

<p>One of the purposes of the charybdis project is to provide a testbed for the research and development of new features in IRC server software.  To this end,
we have contributed patches to other IRC software, such as <a href="http://www.ratbox.org/">ratbox</a> and <a href="http://coder-com.undernet.org/">ircu</a>.</p>

<p>Charybdis is originally based on ratbox 2.0, with some additional code from ircu 2.11, but a large number of features from Charybdis were integrated back
into ratbox with ratbox 3, and ircu 2.12, and contributions are contributed bi-directionally on a regular basis.  To this extent, Charybdis can be considered
a top-level IRCd project, and not a patchset to a different IRCd project.</p>

<p>As part of our mission, we have collaborated with other IRCd projects besides ratbox and ircu, in terms of technical development, such as 
  <a href="http://www.unrealircd.org/">UnrealIRCd</a> and <a href="http://www.inspircd.org/">InspIRCd</a>.  The Charybdis project also is represented in the 
  <a href="http://ircv3.atheme.org/">IRCv3 working group</a>, which itself is incubated by Atheme.</p>
