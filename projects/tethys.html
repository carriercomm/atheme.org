  <h1>tethys <small>a next-generation irc daemon</small></h1>
</div>

<p class="lead">tethys is the next-generation ircd project from Atheme.org. Based on the rock-solid <a href="/projects/libmowgli.html">libmowgli-2 framework</a>,
  tethys is the first irc daemon being designed from the ground up to be <a href="http://ircv3.atheme.org/">IRCv3 compliant</a>.</p>
  
<p>Originally called <em>ircd-micro</em>, tethys has been designed from day one to be the fastest and most scalable irc daemon around. Although 
  the project's ambitions have changed somewhat from the time of it's conception, the focus remains clear: to provide a stable, IRCv3 compliant daemon
  which will withstand the test of time.</p>
  
<p>Just like <a href="/projects/charybdis.html">charybdis</a>, tethys integrates perfectly with the Atheme IRC platform and has a fully modular design, 
  allowing IRC networks to choose the features important to them, and easily extend the server software to suit their own specific needs.</p>
  
<p>Although still in early development, tethys is already TS6 feature complete and subject to alpha-testing within the Atheme Project. Our 
  home network, <a href="http://atheme.org/network/">AthemeNet</a>, has a tethys server linked to the charybdis network in order to help detect
  bugs and give a preview of the new software to Atheme members. </p>
