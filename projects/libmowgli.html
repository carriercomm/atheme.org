  <h1>libmowgli <small>the core framework for atheme applications</small></h1>
</div>

<p>Mowgli (libmowgli) is the core framework for Atheme applications.  It contains a large
class library and super-scalable multiprocessing model, built around a high performance
eventing subsystem, as well as a number of high-performance data structures.  It also
handles abstraction of portability issues by using a lightweight abstraction layer and
platform-specific implementations where needed.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the Mowgli project is to enable write-once, compile-everywhere
functionality with consistent and predictable behaviour for all projects using the library
on all officially supported Atheme platforms. Almost all Atheme projects have been ported to 
take advantage of Mowgli since thelibmowgli-1 era.</p>

    <h2>Getting involved</h2>
    <p>Like many other projects at Atheme, the Mowgli project makes heavy use of IRC for
      coordinating development.  You can access our IRC channel <a href="/contact.html">on this
      page</a>.</p>
    <p>The IRC channel contains a mixture of development discussion, commit notifications,
      and other forms of automated notifications such as build status reports.</p>
    <p>It is also a good resource for developers interested in building apps with Mowgli.</p>

    <h2>Contributing patches</h2>
    <p>The typical workflow we use for contributions is to use GitHub's pull request feature.  To
submit a pull request, you simply fork the repository on GitHub, commit your chances to
that fork, and send us a pull request containing your changes.</p>
    <p>Once the pull request is submitted, it will be considered by the steering committee.</p>

    <h3>Steering committee</h3>
    <p>The steering committee consists of the committers which have direct push access to the
      main repository and also make the day-to-day project management decisions for the Mowgli
      project.</p>
    
    <p>Presently, the steering committee consists of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Alex Iadicicco (aji@)</li>
